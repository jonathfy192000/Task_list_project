7:30 CST, CTF


Database needed:

	database for each school
	school database:
		department name, course name, namedtuple containing start, due, info, tips
each course is going to have it's own database: school_name followed by course_name, like UCI_143A


global vars for semaphores:
	one for each school
	store the semaphores in a list, access by index, if semaphore is 0, present an error message (later want to implement wait queue)
	

lot of push and pull to sql databases

probably later also want to implement user accounts so they can actually have their own planners, and easily add/remove tasks from the school
	databases


Finish code first, then work on GUI, if I can learn and use PyQt then do that otherwise do Tkinter
